* In your terminal enter **mkdir** to make a new directory. This makes a new folder for the environment your going to create.
* Then enter **python3 -m venv (name of environment)** to create a new virtual environment.
* After that you want to enter **source (name of environment)/bin/activate** on Unix/MacOS or **(name of environment)\Scripts\activate.bat** on Windows to activate the virtual environment. 

>##### *please note where you see (name of environment) its litteraly the name of your environment minus the parenthesis*

<br>
Once you have compleated the steps above your now able to continue with the steps below.

* Enter **pip install django** to install Django
* Then enter **pip install -r requirements.txt**
* It would be good to do a *sanity* check after by entering **pip freeze** This prompt shows all project dependencies installed.  Just to make sure everthing is in order to move forward.

## <div align="center">***How To Run The Django App***</div>
---
<br>
Now that your virtual environment is created and up and running and Django is installed. Your now ready to create a Django project and application.

First you want to create the project
* Enter **django-admin startproject (the name of your project)**

Then you want to enter the folder of the project you just created.
* **cd (the name of your project)**

Then you want to run the server
* Enter **python manage.py runserver** when you go to the local host in your browser *localhost:8000* you should see the pic below.

Once you have the server running you can now create an app.
* Enter **python manage.py startapp (the name of your app)**

Its best for you then to register your new app with your project. From your explorer in VS Code you want to navigate to the name of your project. In that folder you'd see **settings.py** enter the python script. In your editor you want to add it to the installed apps portion.
*       INSTALLED_APPS= [
        '(app name).app.(AppnameConfig)'],
        *It's important that the first letter is uppercase as well as the 'C' in config.
    
At this point you should be in sync with the project you created. Now you can migrate the database.
* Enter **python manage.py migrate**

Then you need to create a *superuser* this would allow you to utilize the admin page. Which allows you to review the data in your database. 
* Enter **python manage.py createsuperuser**
Follow the prompt, create a username and password
